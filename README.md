Overview:
This project was to create an application to act as the middle platform between smaller independent furniture manufacturers and their online customers. It would give customers a way to better envision the company’s products with the use of augmented reality. Users of the app can place virtual furniture in their own living environment. If they like the way it looks and fits, they can see further details and then click a link to the product details page on the company’s website.

We wanted to do a project around ARKit because it was a new technology that interested us all. Due to it being difficult to work around 3D models in Swift, we decided to use Unity for our dev work.
